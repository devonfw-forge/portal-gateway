= Portal Gateway

This is a demo of the Portal Gateway. It is a lean JavaScript / Java solution to integrate microservices and 3rd party
applications into one portal so that a user has the impression that he works with one system, although it is made up of
parts run in their own processes.

=== Install prerequisites

You need a Git client and Java 8 installed on your machine.

=== Install the Project Seed

Clone the `portal-gateway` repository:

....
git clone https://github.com/devonfw-forge/portal-gateway.git
....

Build the application:

....
cd portal-gateway
mvnw clean package
....

this may take several minutes for the first time.

Run app1, app2 and the Portal Gateway itself (note: each command below starts a separate process):

....
java -jar app1\target\app1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
java -jar app2\target\app2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
java -jar portal-gateway\target\portal-gateway-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
....

Open http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080] in your browser.

Enjoy :)
